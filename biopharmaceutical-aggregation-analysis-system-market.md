<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biopharmaceutical Aggregation Analysis System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nanometer (<100 nm)</li><li>Submicron (100 nm to 1 μm)</li><li>Subvisible (1 to 100 μm)</li><li>Visible (>100 μm)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Biopharmaceutical Aggregation Analysis System market is segmented based on particle size, which impacts the stability and safety of biopharmaceutical products. Nanometer-sized aggregates (<100 nm) pose a risk to drug efficacy and immunogenicity. Submicron aggregates (100 nm to 1 μm) often indicate early degradation. Subvisible particles (1 to 100 μm) can compromise product quality and patient safety. Visible particles (>100 μm) are major quality concerns and typically lead to product rejection, making size categorization crucial for biopharmaceutical development.</p></p>
