<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Constant Velocity Joint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Outboard Joints</li><li>Inboard Joints</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive constant velocity joint market comprises two primary types: outboard joints and inboard joints. Outboard joints are typically located at the wheels, facilitating power transfer while allowing for steering and suspension movement. They handle greater angles and provide smooth transitions during turns. Inboard joints, positioned closer to the transmission, accommodate less severe angles and support axial movement. Both types are essential for ensuring efficient torque transfer and enhanced vehicle performance, particularly in front-wheel and all-wheel drive systems.</p></p>
