<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Basket Strainers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Simplex Basket Strainers</li><li>Duplex Basket Strainers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Basket strainers are filtration devices used to remove debris and particles from fluids in pipelines. There are two main types: Simplex and Duplex basket strainers. Simplex basket strainers feature a single strainer design, allowing for straightforward installation and maintenance but requiring system shutdown for cleaning. In contrast, Duplex basket strainers consist of two strainers, enabling continuous operation as one can be cleaned while the other is in use. This dual setup makes Duplex strainers ideal for critical applications needing uninterrupted flow.</p></p>
